Metro Events is an application designed to help everyone organize and join events. The idea is to have a way people connect to each other publicly. No invitations needed. This app contains 3 users: user, organizer and administrator. Users of the app can receive notifications regarding upcoming events. An organizer of the app is registered as regular user first. A request to be an organizer is then sent to the administrator for review. The administrator manages the app from granting regular user to be an administrator to everything about the users and events. Events can be of any type of event. Eg. Trail Biking, Basketball Games, Zumba Sessions and up to bigger events like Univercity, Run-for-a-cause etc. An event contains participants, upvotes and reviews for the users who are interested.  A user can request an interest to join an event where the organizer of the event reviews the request as well as the user requesting and can either accept or decline the request. Notifications will be sent also to users whose request for a certain event is accepted or declined. Reminders regarding upcoming event/s that a user is participating are also sent as notification. An event can also be cancelled and users participating will received notifications with details regarding why the said event is cancelled.
